# <Work-Day-Schedule>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
In this challenge, as an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. I am given a starter code on this challenge and I have to use the daily planner to create a schedule. When the planner is openned, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calender. When I scoll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am to 5pm). When I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When I click into the time block, then I can enter an event and click save for that time block. Then the text for that event with be saved in the local storage. And when the page is refreshed, the saved event persist. 

My motivation for this challenge was to show what I have learned during my 5th week in the bootcamp. I still struggle to ### what I learnt but the course materials and recordings are very useful. The project was built was to display what I have understood from the past week's learning but I think that I needed more time to really dive deep into. As usual with working with all my challenges, I face bugs and codes that I did not understand or wasn't able to solve, I spent time looking through codes and only to realize that it was one small typo error. But the satisfaction of finding the bug motivated me to learn better.
